### Differences: 

Syntax:  CSS follows a plain-text syntax, whereas SCSS follows a more structured syntax with additional features such as variables, nesting, and mixins. 


Variables: SCSS allows you to define variables to store commonly used values such as colors, font sizes, and spacing, whereas CSS does not.
